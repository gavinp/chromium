// This class exposes a static method that receives a vector of TitleInfo
// objects so that it can find the length of the common prefixes among all
// the titles. It can be used for tab titles for example so that the common
// prefixes can be elided.
// First, the caller needs to fill a vector of TitleInfo objects with the titles
// for which they want to find the common prefix lengths. They can also provide
// an optional caller_value where the index of the tabs could be saved
// for example. This way the caller can remember which tab this title belongs
// to, if not all tabs are passed into the vector.
// When CalculatePrefixLengths returns, the TitleInfo objects in the vector
// are set with the prefix_length that is common between this title
// and at least one other.
// Note that the prefix_length is only calculated at word boundaries.

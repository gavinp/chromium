  <p>
  In order to prevent Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks from
  being perpetrated by web pages or extensions that run within Chrome, the
  HTTP throttling mechanism keeps track of errors requesting a given URL
  (minus the query parameters), and after a few 5xx errors in a row, starts
  exponentially increasing an interval during which requests to the
  given URL are disallowed.
  </p><p>
  This feature is currently configured to affect only requests
  initiated by origins with one of the following schemas:
  <ul>
    <li> chrome-extension:// </li>
  </ul>
  </p><p>
  The feature is on by default (for requests originating from the
  schemas listed above). You may disable the feature below if desired.
  Please let us know if the feature is causing problems for your web
  site.  More details and contact information at
